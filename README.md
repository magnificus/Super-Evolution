## Background

This repository contains the mostly successful experiment with regression analysis using genetic programming, so in a nutshell, given an arbitrary number of sample points containing the values of different input variables along with the output result, it'll try to find an equation that saisfies these conditions. The exciting thing about this approach is that it in theory works for any equation, it's not limited to for example linear regression or quadratic regression.
